# My Unity DOTS Experiments Project

This project contains my experiments with Unity DOTS.
The Unity Project itself can be found in the myunitydotsexperiments folder.
It was created with the 2020.3.26 version of Unity and it uses the Entities 0.17.
Within the project the EmissionMasking folder contains my experiments with URP Emission Masking with DOTS.
